I am a college student studying Computer Science and will graduate in 2025. I am highly motivated and passionate about using my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact in the world. In the future, I plan to utilize my skills and experience in the Intelligence Community or Defense Industry, where I can make a meaningful contribution to national security and the protection of our country.
